        <p>I believe I'd be a good fit for Sphere's culture because our values sync well. The mere fact that Sphere requires their candidates to show why they are a good fit for your culture so early in the hiring process, tells me that Sphere (and the people behind it) are <b>dedicated to assembling something more genuine that the typical startup</b>. <br><br>Below is the best way I can show how my values align with Sphere's.</p>

                        <h3>A few years back, I was a foreman for a lawn company, in charge of three crew members. One day, I was working a crew member named Tyler. While we were mowing a lawn, Tyler lost control of his mower and shattered a neighbor’s fence to pieces. <br><br>Some foremen would have acted like nothing happened, and waited for the neighbor to call and complain; others would have made Tyler knock on the neighbor’s door and confront the consequences by himself. But as for me, I knocked on the door of the neighbor and took Tyler’s mishap as my own. I didn’t do this because I have a martyr complex -I was terrified to do it. <br><br>I did this because Tyler was my guy and his problems were my problems. In the end, the neighbor was understanding and we repaired his fence a week later, and Tyler became a loyal member of my crew there after. <b>I believe in being the change I want to see in this world</b>, and what I did for Tyler is what commitment means to me. So, if Sphere’s culture revolves around commitment then you can bet I’ll be a committed team player.</h3>

And it’s a curse because <b>every time I’m satisfied, I then use my satisfaction as a platform to define the new normal and from which I then try to reach ever higher heights</b>. <br><br>If I wasn’t constantly maximizing, I could enjoy the American dream of Netflix binging and dreading Monday, instead I push myself into the uncomfortable feeling of occupying new territory, then conquering it as my own. <b>It causes much anxiety and exhilaration, yet I think it’s addicting</b>.

                        <h3>One of my more recent projects had me working closely with a partner. We were tasked with designing from the ground up a social platform for recording and sharing travel experiences. Fortunately and unfortunately, this partner was a good friend of mine: Fortunate because we enjoyed each other, and unfortunate because <b>we intimately knew each other’s typical pitfalls</b>. <br><br>We had to learn to trust each other's intuition and respect each other's feedback. During the project, we would structure our day by first meeting with each other to discuss the current direction of our work flow and any issues we were encountering. Half way through the day, we would also regroup to have a second meeting of a similar nature to the one we had in the morning. We developed this method organically at first, then more formally there after. <b>We recognized a need to have open communication and be on the same page with design decisions since the project was huge and an independent actor could cause serious problems down the road</b>. <br><br>We came to formalize these meet ups to keep trust and mutual respect in tact, and to strengthen the integrity of the project by creating style guides, layout changes, and foreseeing new challenges. It took a lot of pride-swallowing from both of us, and the end product was a cohesive design and an even greater friendship. <b>This is the type of trust and co-operation I hope to bring and find at Sphere</b>.</h3>

                        <h3>A while back I worked as the HR manager for a small company. <b>The chief issue facing the company wasn’t new business, but high employee turnover</b>. Most employees left the company mainly because they felt that they had no future within it. <br><br>Working with the owners, I soon discovered that the company didn’t have a formal structure for employees to rise through. The company grew out of a family business and was not equipped with formal processes to keep employees who didn’t share the owner’s last name. So, <b>I took it upon myself to develop a company manual</b> that would detail the mission and vision of the company, the pay structure and future development of employees, and formal channels of complaint and discipline. <br><br>I studied other company manuals and worked closely with the owners and employees to develop a open, yet structured, system of operation. The owners had to be convinced at first that this was a project worth pursuing. Yet now, after a couple years since I left the company, they still use this manual today. This is the sort of initiative I plan on bringing to Sphere.</h3>
